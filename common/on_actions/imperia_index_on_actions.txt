# Root owner Country of the Law
# executed when the law is activated for any reason. It's usually because it
# has been enacted, but script can activate laws directly without going through
# the enactment process. Normally, it's immediately preceded by
# on_law_enactment_ended, but if a law is directly set by script, thus
# bypassing the enactment process, this will execute while
# on_law_enactment_ended will not
#
# NOTE: unlike the other on_law_<something> on-actions, at the point in time
# when this is triggered the law that was enacted is no longer considered being
# enacted. Therefore using the `currently_enacting_law` link will return the
# null law
