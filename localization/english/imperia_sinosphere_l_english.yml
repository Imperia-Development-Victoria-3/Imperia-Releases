je_korean_writing_system: "The Issue of Hanja"
je_korean_writing_system_reason: "As a result of our prolonged contact with the Chinese cultural sphere, Chinese customs and creations have been prevalent in the Korean Peninsula for over 1300 years. The most notable exemplar of Chinese influence in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] can be seen in our official writing system, which comprises Chinese characters adapted to represent the Korean language. This unwieldy combination is a poor suit for the actual needs of our written language, hampering literacy and consequently our development."

je_vietnamese_writing_system: "The Issue of Chu Han"
je_vietnamese_writing_system_reason: "As a result of our prolonged contact with the Chinese sphere of influence, Chinese customs and creations have been prevalent in the Red River Delta for over nearly two millennia. The most notable exemplar of Chinese influence in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] can be seen in our official writing system, which comprises Chinese characters adapted to represent the Vietnamese language. While not wholly unsuited to the needs of our written language, such a system does hamper literacy."

je_future_of_xinjiang: "The Fate of Xinjiang"
je_future_of_xinjiang_reason: "Formed from the conquests of the Qing Dynasty against the Dzungar Khanate, the region of Xinjiang has long been earmarked for further settlement as one of the frontier regions of China. A steady flow of military garrisons and Han migrants stream into the frontier, integrating it further with the central government. However, tensions with the local Uighur Turks have risen as a result, and if Chinese authority in the region were to suddenly collapse, the fate of Xinjiang, and that of its Han settlers will be left up in the air"

imperia_sinosphere.1.f: ""Hanja is the foundation of our classical literature, our philosophy, and our understanding of the universe. To discard it is to sever ourselves from our ancestors and the wisdom they have passed down through generations!" \n\n "The world is changing rapidly. Can we afford to remain shackled to the past? In the grand pursuit of strengthening [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName], Hanja is a relic of the past, an obstacle to our progress.""

imperia_sinosphere.1.a: "Hanja will remain, though we must take steps to improve its accessibility to the masses."
imperia_sinosphere.1.b: "A mixed script written with both Hanja and Hangul will serve as a suitable compromise."

imperia_sinosphere.2.d: "As the beginnings of a formal education system start to emerge in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName], debate has heated up regarding the role of Chu Han in Vietnamese society and whether such a system is truly suited for the needs of our people."

imperia_sinosphere.4.t: "Crisis in the Front Palace"
imperia_sinosphere.4.d: "Before his death, King Nangklao had failed to properly nominate a successor, leaving his sons Mongkut and Pinklao as prospective candidates to the throne. Though technically disqualified by his status as a monk, it would not be a controversial matter if Prince Mongkut were to defrock and take the throne."
imperia_sinosphere.4.f: "The dim glow of oil lamps flickered across the gilded walls of the Samuha Kalahom's residence as Sir James Brooke sets his teacup down with deliberate care. Across from him, the Kalahom - Somdet Chaophraya Prayurawongse - remained still, his expression unreadable. \n\n"Prince Mongkut has devoted himself to the Sangha. Asking him to cast aside his vows is no small matter." \n"And yet is it not the greater duty of a prince to serve his people? The world is watching, Your Excellency. The British Crown, the French, they look upon Siam with keen interest. An enlightened king could ensure stability and...favorable relations." \n"The Front Palace still stands, and Pinklao is not without his supporters." \n"Then let wisdom prevail. Surely you of all men have the influence to guide the Prince towards his destiny." \n\nThe Kalahom exhaled slowly, his gaze drifting toward the palace spires in the distance; the weight of the future pressed upon them both."

imperia_sinosphere.4.a: "Convince Prince Mongkut to defrock for the sake of the country."
imperia_sinosphere.4.b: "We must respect the Prince's devotion!"

imperia_sinosphere.5.t: "Prince Mindon's Coup"
imperia_sinosphere.5.d: "Following the disastrous loss of Lower Burma, the Burmese nobility have begun to turn against the monarch."
imperia_sinosphere.5.f: ""The King still believes the gods will strike down the foreigners with pestilence. Meanwhile, their flag flies over Rangoon and their steamships stalk the Irrawaddy River. We cannot wait for miracles!" \n\n"And would you have us do? Rebel? The people still believe in the sanctity of the throne." \n\nThe foreigners did not win because their gods are stronger. They won because their weapons and machines are better. We must learn or we will vanish. We must build a Burma that does not fear the future, one with schools that teach more than scripture and with an army that does not rely on elephant charges against cannons. " \n\n"The King will call that treasonous." \n\n"Then let him. But ask yourself, is it a greater treason to change, or let our kingdom die unchanged?""

imperia_sinosphere.5.a: "Let us enthrone Prince Mindon as King of a renewed [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]"
imperia_sinosphere.5.b: "The King's loyalists defeat the Prince's revolt!"
