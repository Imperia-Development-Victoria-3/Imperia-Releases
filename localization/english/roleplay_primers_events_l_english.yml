 ottoman_primer_event.1.t: "The Eternal State"
 ottoman_primer_event.1.d: " For a long time, the Ottomans were the horror of the Europeans. Within a very short time, the Empire expanded from a small Anatolian state to a world power. The defining and unifying values were clear, bravery and Islam that held the empire together for centuries. Since 1570, the Ottoman Sultan has automatically been the Caliph of Islam and thus the protector and representative of the Islamic world. Admired by fellow Muslims and hated by the West, the Ottoman Empire moves into the new age a shadow of its former self. When Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Constantinople, he assured his new subjects that they would not be forced into either religion or culture and would recieve his proection universally. This is still true today; The Empire offers all its subjects freedoms that no other empire grants.... But not necessarily a voice."

 ottoman_primer_event.2.d: "Dark clouds are gathering. The Eternal State, the glorious Ottoman Empire, caliphate and protector of the entire Islamic world, the rulers of the Balkans and the Middle East, the conquerors of Constantinople, the besiegers of Vienna seem to be receding. European powers are trying to unleash uprisings that are spreading in the Balkans and other parts of the empire in order to weaken us and our authority! Minorities demand freedom! Total independence! Our economic and research capabilities are lagging behind, as the Janissaries have made reforms impossible in the past... But now you are Sultan, YOU must make the right decisions to keep the Eternal Empire alive and reawaken it. Lead the Ottoman Empire back to a glorious age! For God and the Sultan!"

Egypt has occupied regions from Palestine to Syria. Regions that are rightfully Ottoman. We must take back what was taken away from us! At the same time, the French and British are massacring Muslim countries in Africa and establishing colonies at the expense of our brothers and sisters! The Ottoman Caliphate must not stand by and watch the Muslim world being wiped out by imperialists! But even worse is the fact that Britain has a dangerous eye on Egypt. The Empire is in trouble and needs far-reaching educational and military reforms also the minorities must be deterred from rebelling. Hard times are coming for the Ottoman Empire. How far will the enemy go to weaken us? But above all, how far will YOU go, Sultan, to maintain the Empire?"

 iranian_primer_event.1.d: "The Qajar’s have ruled Iran for the last forty years, founded by the success of Agha Mohammad Khan in a civil war that saw a new dynasty be born. He was a man who saw the old borders of Iran as ours by right, and led campaigns into the Caucasus and border regions to take what is ours. He achieved many successes and expanded the Qajar Empire greatly, before being assassinated by cowards. His heirs have since struggled with the Russians and Ottomans alike who have pushed back the borders and shattered our armies in recent wars. The Qajar family is a proud one, but not the most innovative. They also struggle greatly much like most of the Iranian elite with Opium, for it is a drug which once tried is near impossible to set aside…"

 iranian_primer_event.2.d: "Iran is home to one of the oldest Empires in the world, for our history is one of power and conquest. Cyrus the Great forged the great Achaemenid Empire, the first of many, and showed that our people were not born simply to exist in mediocrity. History has been harsh, however, and though many more empires followed like the Seleucids, Parthians, and Safavids, we have slowly lost our glory. The Seleucids fell to those who carried the banner of Allah, succeeding where the Byzantines had failed for centuries. Yet from them our people came to know the holy word, finding peace in the one true God. The heights of our people were in this era, yet as the Mongols invaded and put our cities to the torch we receded once more. The great shah Ismail I founded the Safavids who ruled truly as an Iranian Empire once more and made Shi'ism the state religion."

He is a man who has been born of war and strife like the rest of us, put in the heart of war to fight against the Russian dogs and named Gazi for it. It shall be him who wrests us back a semblance of honor and glory that should be ours by right, or he who pushes us over the edge to nothing as thralls of the west or slaves of the north. The last of his rebellious kin have been caught or defeated; although there is peace, it is hard to tell. Our cities are in ruin, the north a wasteland from the wars with our enemies and even Khorasan is beset by rebels seeking independence. His incorporation of the British military advisors is dangerous but at least his army is no longer simple tribesmen, a modern military force to rival even the Ottomans, though few in number. In the coming months and years, we will see if he is the man to bring us deliverance."

When the French Empire under Napoleon chose to work with the bear instead of us the Russians waged war after war and annexed the caucuses, taking land that is our right! Their merchants act with impunity in our land and refuse to pay back their massive debt to the state and moneylenders. If we do not find strong allies our sovereignty will not last for long for as soon as central Asia falls to their influence we are doubtless next.. Russia has declared its desire to get a port in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. The British are the obvious choice for a friend as they already have troops and diplomats in our capital, but they are known for their pragmatic approach to diplomacy and lack of loyalty."

We as Spaniards have never shirked our duty to enlighten people of Christ, progress, and civilization. We drove the Muslim invaders out so our people could feel safe once more after centuries of brutality. Since then we have lifted the people of the new world up from the depths of despair to a more enlightened society. Yet as we secured the untamed wilderness of the new world our civilizing efforts were cut short by the revolutions in France and the betrayal of our French allies in 1808 and after years of bloody warfare we drove the invaders out and our country was free once more! What did it cost, however? Our empire."

This change in succession law upset the brother of Ferdinand, Don Carlos (29 March 1788 – 10 March 1855) Seeing himself as the true king of a “traditional monarchy” started an uprising against the Madrid liberals which supports the regency of Isabella II only three as of now in 1836, with a constitution limiting the power of the monarch, to restore the most progressive features of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and to entrench the concepts of constitutionalism, parliamentarians, and separation of powers in Spain."

Would it be under the regency of Isabella II bringing liberal rule over Spain where the monarchy will have its powers curtailed with a fair hand of stability for the people or under Carlos and a return to a more traditional monarchy and a possible return to Spanish glory? Will we see Spain rise up and return to greatness or shall we see it turn into a middling power with limited influence or the possibility of the total dismantlement of the Spanish state and thus the end of a unified Spanish experiment of 400 years"

 france_primer_event.1.t: "Heirs Of Napoleon"
 france_primer_event.1.d: "After the exile of Napoleon, the French Monarchy was restored by the House of Bourbon who instituted a conservative government intended to restore the proprieties, if not all the institutions, of the Ancien Régime. The exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France but despite their effort were unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution. Exhausted by decades of war, the nation experienced a period of internal and external peace, stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialisation, led by Louis XVIII. But this period of prosperity was not long lived. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the Ancien Régime, which was absolutist in it's ideology. This caused the power of the Royal family and Louis XVIII to reduce substantially. To combat their decline of power he decided to disband the parliament, giving rise to the popularity of the Liberal Doctrinaires. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. This would only further legitimise the Monarchy."

 france_primer_event.2.d: "His reign of almost six years proved to be deeply unpopular amongst the liberals in France from the moment of his coronation in 1825, in which he tried to revive the practice of the royal touch. The governments appointed under his reign reimbursed former landowners for the abolition of feudalism at the expense of bondholders, increased the power of the Catholic Church, and reimposed capital punishment for sacrilege, which ;ed to major conflicts with the liberal-majority of the Chamber. Charles also approved the French conquest of Algeria as a way to distract his citizens from domestic problems, and forced Haiti to pay a hefty indemnity in return for lifting a blockade and recognizing Haiti's independence. After losing having his own conservative government defeated by the French legislative elections, He responded with the July Ordinances disbanding the Chamber of Deputies, limiting franchise, and reimposing press censorship. Within a week France faced urban riots which led to the July Revolution of 1830, which resulted in his abdication and the election of Louis Philippe I as King of the French."

 france_primer_event.3.d: "The French Revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution, Second French Revolution, or Trois Glorieuses ('Three Glorious (days)') led to the overthrow of King Charles X, The French Bourbon monarch, and the ascent of his cousin Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. The Revolution marked a shift from one constitutional monarchy, under the restored House of Bourbon, to another, the July Monarchy, and the replacement of the principle of hereditary right by that of popular sovereignty.This renewed French Revolution sparked an August uprising in Brussels and the Southern Provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, leading to separation and the establishment of the Kingdom of Belgium. The example of the July Revolution also inspired unsuccessful revolutions in Italy and the November Uprising in Poland. It is not certain how long the Monarchy will remain, as the July Monarchy remains doubtfully popular, but disliked for different reasons by both Right and Left."

As colonialism grows quickly in importance and global trade become more the defining factors of a great power, we are among few equals in this regard. If we are able to out manuever the British and other fledgling great powers with our natural bounty our ascendence once more to superpwoer status is all but assured. However, in order to achieve this we will need to find allies, as most of Europe still remembers well our recent actions and the destruction and conquest we caused. "

 portugal_primer_event.1.d: "For Portugal it has been two years since the end of the six year long period of chaos known as the Liberal Wars which was largely a proxy war between liberalism vs conservatism in western Europe. The United Kingdom and France supported the victorious liberal faction of Pedro I while Russia and the Carlists in Spain supported the conservatives under Miguel I. Unfortunately, Dom Pedro would die of tuberculosis only months before the victory leaving his young daughter Maria II of the house of Braganza as the country’s ruler. The 16 year old queen is rumored by many in court to be interested in reading and wishes to modernize the country’s health and education policies. She keeps written correspondence with a number of European nobility, liberal thinkers, and even the heir apparent of Great Britain Victoria. Queen Maria II of Portugal must maintain a careful balance between the liberal constitutionalists and the reactionary forces in the military or church if she wishes to avoid another civil war. Only time will tell how the young queen's reign bodes for the country still economically healing from the Napoleonic wars and recent civil wars."

We once had a massive colonial empire which spanned the planet, but with Brazil indpendent, and our holdings in Asia longa go pillaged and  taken by the Dutch and British we have little left to build upon. Yet it is our minor status combined with our traditions that could be our opportunity to rise once more. The British and French are hated the world over, while we are not. It is time to reinforce our old economic ties and bring our old colonies back into the fold through either diplomacy or war. If we are careful and build upon our naval strength and traditions we could be great once more. "

Soon after his coronation he began removing autonomies; Bessarabia in 1828 and Poland in 1830 , with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Finland, which loyally send soldiers to help put down the Polish uprising in 1830, and Increasing the Grand Duchy Lithuania's autonomy to the same level as Finland. Tough he wasn't one to institute liberal reforms, he knew serfdom was one institution he certainly had to reform, due to the simple reason that if Russia is to thrive, ordinary Russians being conscripted must have a reason to fight, and not to return to a petty noble's lands to farm until eternity."

It is from their authority and the harsh traditions of our people that serfdom continues. A system where a man is beholden to the land he is born upon and nothing but a slave to his landowner. Although this system makes our nobility rich it makes us weak as our people are stuck at most subsistance farming."

After our independence was guaranteed by international governments, a national congress was created. Fears of mob rule just like with the French revolution, stirred in the hearts of the nobility. In order to stem this tide it was decided that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. Many candidates were looked at in order to fulfill this role but the congress chose Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, due to his extensive military career fighting for the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic wars as well as being connected to the other European Monarchies.

What differentiated this nation from so many others in the Holy Roman Empire was the House of Hohenzollern which ruled over it. Originally a family from southern Germany, they inherited lands in the north and quickly made them their own. Generations of careful administration and minor expansion compounded until it became one of the larger states in the northern part of Europe. It was King Freidrich the Great who made it into true power, with his tactical genius and unending ambition, and courage. Prussia was forged during his reign through fire and blood, with the darkest days of the 7 year war seeing our nation fight off most of the European great powers at once. The successes of his wars over Austria and their allies despite overwhelming odds would eventually be compounded by several partitions of Poland. By the Napoleonic wars, they were the undisputed power of the region alongside Austria."

During this period of instability, we would force our influence on many Germanic states, even occupying British-allied Hanover. When Napoleons Empire became too much of a threat to ignore any longer, the peace was broken and over the years that followed would fight desperately. Prussia was pivotal in the destruction of Napoleon throughout his wars against Europe and particularly in the battle of Waterloo.

In addition, the beginnings of a parliament were created in a council of advisors who would at this time primarily still be aristocrats, and the Kings favorites though this is quickly changing into a proper political body.

Muhammad Ali was ambitious, intelligent, and capable commander. He forced the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to acknowledge his autonomy and eventually full independence. His rule saw wars against Arabia to put the tribes in their place, the ousting of the Mamluks from power, and a failed attempt to reform the military to the standards of the west. The latter of which caused a mutiny that would permanently stop his attempts at military reform. Economically he took the radical step of abolishing all private property, displacing a landowner class that had ruled for centuries. With near total power in Egypt, Muhammad Ali would create state-run monopolies which built state-run factories in an attempt to industrialize the nation. This combined with the widespread growing of Cotton and exports to the west would bring him much wealth and catapult Egypt's prospects forward. On the other hand, it showed the west yet again just how valuable Egypt was…"

The Sultan no longer dares to demand actions from us, but we share a history and helped them in the war of Greek Independence. The recent Egyptian-Ottoman war lasted for 2 years and came about by the need of Egypt for resources it lacked such as coal and timber. The levant and Syria proved to be the perfect solution though we had to pry it from the weak fingers of the Sultan. Though we now control this land it is an unstable occupation, as the land reforms that followed under Ali as well as widespread conscription were not popular.

The French invaded our lands for the possibility of building the canal and still seek to do so, though the current government is largely disinterested. Trade has flowed through our lands and the Sinai for thousands of years, bringing incense from Yemen in the early days to Rome and the Byzantines. Later it would be a conduit of trade bringing sandalwood and porcelain from China, spices from the Eastern islands, and all other manners of Eastern goods. The route around the cape of Africa certainly provided another avenue of goods and made Europe rich yet trade continued through our lands. If we or another were to split the Sinai finally, it would create an unprecedented amount of trade through our borders!

China's government restricted trade to the merchant classes in Guangzhou, causing Western powers to denounce these trade barriers. Despite British attempts to renegotiate trade relations, China maintained its isolationist stance. As a result, Britain began exporting opium to China, in violation of China's 1729 prohibition edict. This opium trade has destabilized China's economy and caused a shortage of silver coins.

 eic_primer_event.1.d: "The British East India Company (EIC) was formed in the year 1600, through a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I. This charter, named Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies, effectively awarded the company a monopoly on English trade from the east of Africa to the west of South America. This charter gave the company such trading rights for a period of 15 years, though later charters that extended their power would begin extending their rule for 20 years at a time. This charter formed the early beginnings of English influence and control over the Indian subcontinent. The first company ships landed at Surat in the Gujarat subah (state) in 1608, with the company establishing its first Indian factories between 1610-1615. In its early days, the company competed with various Dutch, French, Spanish, and Portuguese expeditions and traders for control over trade in the region, particularly the very lucrative spice trade. Their relationship with Dutch traders from Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) was particularly tense, and was partially the cause of four wars to be fought between the English (later British) and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries. Early EIC trade was focused around valuable spices indigenous to the region, before fabrics and textiles became a major export of the EIC to Britain."

This series of acts set the stage for increased EIC influence and control over India, as the company aimed to hold a monopoly over all trade in the Indian Ocean. Over the next century, the company used their newfound wealth and political power to lobby Parliament into further securing their monopoly on Indian trade. While for a short period of time there was a parallel English trading company that was a source of competition for the EIC, the two companies eventually merged in 1708, as the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies. For over a century, the EIC enjoyed an effective monopoly over British trade in India and China that was protected by the British Crown.

This was achieved both through diplomatic channels and alliances made with local leaders, as well as through forceful conquest. The EIC first began using Indian sepoys, or infantrymen, to protect company assets. Eventually by the late 1700s, the EIC had formalized these sepoys into three presidency armies, one for each presidency, or province of British India.

The beginning of the EIC’s loss of power and control over India and its trade monopoly began in 1793, with the Charter Act stating that all political functions of the company are on behalf of the British Crown. The EIC trade monopoly lasted in effect until 1813, when British Parliament, while continuing to extend the company’s charter to administer the lands by an additional 20 years, effectively ended the company’s commercial monopoly over trade in the region. While the company still had rights to administer British lands in India, a clause in this act affirmed the British Crown’s undoubted sovereignty over all company territories, as well as opening up India to Christian missionaries for the first time. The only trade monopoly that remained in control of the EIC after 1813 was tea trade with China, though this would not last much longer either. 20 years later in 1833, British Parliament ended the commercial activities of the EIC, including this trade monopoly over tea to China, leaving the company with purely administrative functions in India."

In response, the shogunate issued a policy for forest preservation and encouraged population control since 1666.Despite having ample resources, it is clear that this self-reliance is not sustainable if we continue to pursue demographic growth.

Our only source of information comes from Dutch traders, who provide us with scientific knowledge. In private academies, Dutch studies are shaping a class of Westernized scholars. While this was necessary at the time to prevent European colonialism, it resulted in complete isolation from Europe's ongoing modernization.While the Sakoku policy was necessary to prevent European colonization, it also limited Japan's exposure to new ideas and technologies that were transforming the world. Japan's prolonged isolation meant that it missed out on significant developments in science, technology, and industry that occurred in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Due to the laxity of the previous shogun dynasty, by 1600, Japan had 300,000 Christians on its soil. However, the spreading of this foreign religion, their intolerance towards other religions, and their submission to the Pope instead of our sacred emperor forced the Tokugawa shoguns of that time to enforce their persecution in 1614. This led to the Shimabara Rebellion in 1637, where an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers were executed by beheading. As western nations grow stronger, we must decide whether to continue this policy and risk angering them or allow the Christian faith to destabilize our realm.

Therefore, restoring the Emperor could potentially provide a clear and straightforward direction for our country without opposition.

The American Experiment is facing one of its most difficult moments in history, and it is up to you to determine whether it will succeed and rise to become a new Great Power away from Europe, or if it will diminish and falter into obscurity."

 sikh_empire_primer_event.1.d: "To remind you my lord the history of your empire is as follows. When Emperor Aurangzeb died the Mhugal empire collapsed and imperial governance or tax collection waned. The collapse was locally quickened by the formation of the khalsa and thus 14 misls (of which 12 where sikh 1 was muslim and 1 was run by a foreigner.). Later on the afghans commanded by shah Mazam attempted to invade Punjab which for the most part put an end to the misls infighting however the muslim controlled misls supported the shah’s invasion. With cunning tactics and regional knowledge you repelled the invaders from your misls and would go on with support to liberate the muslim misls founding the sikh empire."

Aside from the princedom of Bikner who are wary of us, the princedoms view us favorably or are at least not belligerent towards us. The east india company takes a dim view of us, not hostile yet but I wouldn’t be surprised if relations deteriorated as they want us to join them. The Qing empire to the north takes offense to us as well however I have my doubts they will do anything major due to the sheer size of their domain. I recommend trying to align ourselves with a great power as the east india company with the support of britain will surely crush us."

 joseon_primer_event.1.t: "Little China"
 joseon_primer_event.1.d: "The national identities of literate Koreans and Chinese are mutually indistinguishable. Korean scholars often used to consider China as the center of the civilized world, and Korea as part of this Sinicize world. Although our culture is different to some aspects, we cannot deny it is greatly influenced by Chinese culture and political thoughts. Belonging to the Chinese culture is not a rigid concept. As it is written in the “Spring and Autumn Annals”, barbarians who adopt the ways of the “Chinese-ness” would be accepted as Chinese, and Chinese people who adopt the ways of the barbarians would be considered barbarians. Hence, the idea of Chinese-ness is a fluid concept and is defined through self-identification and cultural affiliation. Respecting this cultural domination, our rulers often adopted a subservience attitude towards the Chinese dynasties, with a clear desire to be part of their cultural world."

 joseon_primer_event.2.d: "But, since the Ming dynasty was overthrown by the Qing dynasty in 1644, the cultural identity of the Joseon kingdom theorized by our scholars have greatly changed. Now, as the center of the civilized world is occupied by barbarians, our Sinicized kingdom is now the last bastion of civilization. By implementing policies of Chinese acculturation  throughout our history, we embody cultural Chineseness authentically better than them. This proves that we are the legitimate successors to Chinese culture and civilization. Hence, it is our duty to get free from the uncivilized and unworthy Qing dynasty that forced us to become their tributary in 1636."

 joseon_primer_event.3.t: "Modernization Crisis"
 joseon_primer_event.3.d: "Since the Manchu invasion, isolationism is implemented in order to protect Chinese tradition from the perversions of the Qing empire and other nations. Our kingdom, although culturally pure and virtuous, is weak. It’s our capability to innovate that permitted our army to have the upper hand during the Japanese invasion of 1592. If we want to regain our independence and defend it, we need to modernize. Although our kingdom is conservative, the ideas of the west could be applied to our government if done over time and not brutally. Although autocratic, the Korean monarchy, via the systems of oral and written petitions, allow the people to be in direct communication with the king. Also, autocracy was also debated among political elites during the beginning of the Joseon dynasty. Since the late 17th century, the Silhak scholars are advocating for the reform of the rigid Confucian social structure, the promotion of Korea’s cultural singularity, the reform of serfdom, and the exchange of technological knowledge with the west. Hence, the basis for the kingdom of Joseon to change is definitely here. But at some point, we will have to decide what defines our nation: aspects of our culture that separate us from the Chinese one, or the ones that makes us part of it. "

 joseon_primer_event.4.t: "Sedo Politic"
 joseon_primer_event.4.d: "Since the reign of king Sunjo, too young to reign when he ascended to the throne, the power of the king has greatly diminished. The power is juggling between two factions from the in-law family of the king : the Andong Kim clan, and Pungyang Jo clan. This situation, called the Sedo politic, is resulting in a rise of corruption, social disorder and popular riots. The two factions are causing terror in the court, as members of the royal family or aristocrats are not allowed to opposed them. Since 1834, the power is in the hands of the Pungyang Jo clan, which believe we should be stricter with the catholics. Following the Sinyu Persecution of 1801, we should be wary of our policy concerning the catholics, as it will rise the interest of western powers. In order to discuss and implement the modernization, we will need to stabilize the political situation of the kingdom, by cooperating with or repressing these two factions. "

 canada_primer_event.1.t: "The Great North"
 canada_primer_event.1.d: "Between 1700 and 1836, the area that would later become Upper and Lower Canada was largely under French control. Lower Canada was established in the early 1700s, and it was primarily a French-speaking territory, with a predominantly French-speaking population. The French played a vital role in shaping the culture, language, and institutions of Lower Canada, leaving a lasting legacy that endures to this day. Upper Canada, on the other hand, was established by the British in 1791 and was primarily an English-speaking territory. The British saw Upper Canada as a chance to establish a loyal and reliable colony, and they went to great lengths to attract English-speaking settlers to the region. Over time, Upper Canada developed a unique culture and identity, shaped by the English settlers who arrived there. Despite their differences, Upper and Lower Canada had much in common. Both colonies were established as part of the British Empire, and both were shaped by their relationship with the mother country. Both colonies were also part of a larger struggle for power and control in North America, as the British and French vied for dominance on the continent."

 canada_primer_event.2.d: "The distinct cultural and linguistic identities of Upper and Lower Canada often led to misunderstandings and conflicts between the two colonies. However, despite these differences, both Upper and Lower Canada continued to thrive and expand. In Upper Canada, new industries emerged, including agriculture and manufacturing, which contributed significantly to the growth and development of the colony. The fertile lands of Upper Canada, along with advances in agricultural technology, helped to create a prosperous farming industry. Similarly, the development of manufacturing industries, such as textiles and ironworks, helped to create new job opportunities and boost the economy. In Lower Canada, the economy was more focused on trade, with the St. Lawrence River serving as a critical transportation route for goods and people. The fur trade was also an essential industry, with fur traders establishing trading posts throughout the region. The growth of these industries helped to increase the population of Lower Canada, with new towns and communities being established along the St. Lawrence River and throughout the region."

 canada_primer_event.3.t: "A Cultural Divide"
 canada_primer_event.3.d: "During the period between the establishment of Upper and Lower Canada and the eventual unification of the two colonies in 1836, the British government invested heavily in building infrastructure to support economic growth. Roads, canals, and other transportation networks were constructed to improve trade and commerce between the colonies and other parts of the British Empire. However, tensions between the French-speaking population of Lower Canada and the English-speaking population of Upper Canada continued to simmer. In Lower Canada, the French-speaking population felt that their rights were being violated by the British colonial government. They believed that the British had established a system that favored English-speaking settlers, leading to the suppression of their language, culture, and political rights. The French-speaking population in Lower Canada thus fought for their rights and freedom in what is now known as the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837-38."

 canada_primer_event.4.d: "In Upper Canada, the situation was somewhat reversed, with the English-speaking population in the majority and the French-speaking minority facing discrimination. Despite the British government's attempts to create a fair and just society, the French-speaking minority still faced obstacles in the political and economic spheres. These tensions between the two colonies were a significant factor in the eventual unification of Upper and Lower Canada in 1836. The merging of the two colonies was seen as a way to address some of the issues that had led to tensions and conflict between the French and English-speaking populations. It was hoped that a more united Canada would be able to overcome these differences and build a stronger, more prosperous nation."
