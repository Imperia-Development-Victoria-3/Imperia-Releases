 vtm_denmark.1.t:0 "The Question Of Schleswig"
 vtm_denmark.1.d:0 "Schleswig and Holstein are two duchies that, while under Danish supervision, are entirely separate from the Danish state itself. A fresh wave of nationalist sentiment demands that Schleswig be integrated directly, so that the Danes living there can finally join their rightful home. Pursuing this noble goal will surely anger the Germans, but will be necessary to make Denmark and, later, Scandinavia whole."
 vtm_denmark.1.f:0 ""In the alleyways of Copenhagen, whispers echo of a united Denmark, its heart swelling with fervor. The duchy of Schleswig, now, merely connected to this young nation by a delicate thread, shall be woven into the fabric of Danish nationalism and Scandinavian unity itself.""
 vtm_denmark.1.a:0 "Denmark to the Eider?"
 vtm_denmark.2.t:0 "Schleswig is not Danish!"
 vtm_denmark.2.d:0 "Despite [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s best efforts, we have failed to integrate Schleswig. While Schleswig may be returned to us one day, this chapter of Danish history has ended in defeat and embarrassment."

 vtm_denmark.2.a:0 "We have failed."
 vtm_denmark.3.t:0 "Schleswig is Danish!"
 vtm_denmark.3.d:0 "With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now in full control of Schleswig, the fervour of Danish and Pan-Scandinavian nationalism has never burned brighter. Hopes are high that this will soon lead to a federation of all the Scandinavians."

 vtm_denmark.5.f:0 ""To achieve the unity of the Danish nation is nothing less than an absolute requirement for any government to call itself loyal to Denmark. Were we to succeed, not only would we do our part as humble servants of the king, but we should also emerge as the leaders of all Scandinavians.""
